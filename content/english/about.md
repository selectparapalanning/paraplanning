  title : "We aim to provide you with all the benefits of having an employed paraplanner, with added flexibility and resource."
  content : "We offer a flexible and bespoke paraplanning service, providing high-quality research and tailored suitability reports to suit your businesses requirements. 
​
We provide outsourced paraplanning services to a range of advisers, from restricted to independent, both directly authorised and network members. We specialise in retirement, investment, protection and Inheritance Tax planning. In addition, our team includes a defined benefit transfer specialist.

After 37 years in the financial services industry, the founder of Select Paraplanning felt a need for high-quality report writing on a flexible basis.

We discovered that companies were taking a step away from in-house paraplanning services with the associated costs and inconsistent workloads. Instead, there was a growing need for tailored, adaptable report writing services.

A Level 4 qualified paraplanner professionally writes all our reports to the highest standard and quality at a fixed cost.
