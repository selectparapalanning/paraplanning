### Valuing Your Time and Budget



###

#### Paraplanning shouldn't break the bank.

Every adviser is different - we understand that. It is why we offer a bespoke approach to fees, which will be agreed upon with you after discussing your requirements. Whether you use PPOL, templates, or guides, we can facilitate this and agree on a fee per report.

#### Instant access to a technical resource when you require

Sometimes you need someone there to help during busy periods. You can hire us on a retainer basis for a time that suits you. This way, you know you have the resources available to deal with your clients without the cost and hassle of full-time employment.

#### Transparent costs, tailored to you

When we have determined what will be required to complete your reports and/or technical research, we will agree on a fee for the work. Please call us to have an initial discussion around your needs, and we can start the process.
