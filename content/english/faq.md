### There are many reasons why you should consider outsourcing your paraplanning!

We believe that the most productive use of an adviser’s time is spent meeting and advising clients. You didn’t become an adviser to sit in an office doing paperwork!
Outsourced paraplanners tend to be very experienced, highly qualified and at the top end of their profession. Employing a full-time paraplanner of a similar calibre will incur high costs, and we know from our own experience how difficult it is to find high calibre paraplanners. Thankfully we have an excellent team in place already so that we can take the hassle away from you.
By outsourcing, you can tap into a wealth of experience for a fraction of the cost and only pay for the service when you need it.
